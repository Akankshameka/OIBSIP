            <b>Youth and Domestic Career</b>
            <p>
                Kohli's junior cricket career kicked off in October 2002 at the Luhnu cricket ground in a Polly Umrigar match against
                the host state of Himachal Pradesh. In his debut match, Kohli managed to score a total of fifteen runs. His first 
                half-century in national cricket came at Ferozeshah Kotla, where he scored 70 runs against Harayana. By the end 
                of the season, Kohli had amassed a total of 172 runs, emerging as the highest run-scorer for his side with an average 
                of 34.40.During the 2003–04 season, Kohli was appointed as the captain of the under-15 team. In his first match 
                of the season, he scored 54 runs in Delhi's victory over Himachal Pradesh. In the next fixture against Jammu and Kashmir, 
                Kohli scored his maiden century with a score of 119 in a BCCI-conducted game. By the end of the season, he had amassed 
                a total of 390 runs at an average of 78, which included two centuries.Towards the end of 2004, Kohli earned 
                selection for the 2004–05 Vijay Merchant Trophy with the Delhi under-17 team.  
            </p>
            <p>
                On 18 February 2006, Kohli made his debut in List A cricket, playing against Services in the Ranji One-Day Trophy,
                but he did not have the opportunity to bat during the match. In 2006, Kohli had garnered enough attention to
                earn a spot in the state senior team. Subsequently, he made his first-class debut on 23 November 2006, during the 
                opening match of the Ranji Trophy season against Tamil Nadu. However, his debut innings was a brief one, as he was
                dismissed after scoring ten runs. In a sequence of three matches, Kohli failed to score a fifty, leading his 
                coaches to provide him with counselling. In the subsequent match against former champions, Karnataka, Delhi found
                themselves trailing with a score of 130/5, with Kohli remaining unbeaten on 40 at the end of the day's play. That 
                very night, Kohli's father passed away at 3:54 a.m. Despite the heart-wrenching news, Kohli returned to the match
                and continued to bat and scored 90 runs before he was dismissed.The team's coach, Chetan Chauhan was 
                impressed by Kohli's resolute determination and unwavering attitude in the face of adversity.

                    <p>
                        In August 2008, Kohli was selected for inclusion in the ODl squad for the tour of Sri Lanka and the 
                    Champions Trophy in Pakistan. Prior to the Sri Lankan tour, Kohli had limited experience, with only 
                    eight List A matches under his belt.[45] So, his selection was considered a "surprise call-up".
                    During the Sri Lankan tour, as both first-choice openers Sachin Tendulkar and Virender Sehwag, 
                    were unable to play due to injury, Kohli was required to fill the role of makeshift opener throughout t
                    he series. On 18 August 2008, Kohli made his international debut at the age of 19 in the first ODI 
                    of the tour, where he was dismissed for 12 runs, caught dead in front by an incutter from Nuwan Kulasekara.
                    However, in the fourth match of the series, Kohli achieved his inaugural half century in the ODl format, 
                    with a total of fifty-four runs scored.

                        In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as 
                        Tendulkar was rested for the event.During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player 
                        to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.He was widely hailed for his performances, and 
                        ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an 
                        impressive average of 91.66.Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash 
                        and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and 
                        that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come 
                        across different to the world.

                        144 by Younis Khan in 2004 and the joint second highest score along with Dhoni in an ODI run-chase; also became 
                        the highest individual score against Pakistan in ODIs.Kohli was awarded the man of the match in both the 
                        matches that India won,nonetheless India could not progress to the final of the tournament.[

                            against Sri Lanka in November enabling Kohli to lead the team for another full series.. In the fifth ODI at Ranchi, he made an unbeaten 139 off 126 balls to give his team a three-wicket win and 
                            a whitewash of Sri Lanka.Kohli was awarded player of the series and it was the second whitewash under his

                        In January 2010, Kohli was given the opportunity in tri-nation ODI tournament in Bangladesh, as 
                        Tendulkar was rested for the event.[65] During the series, Kohli became just the third Indian player 
                        to score two ODI centuries before the age of 22.[66] He was widely hailed for his performances, and 
                        ultimately emerged as the leading run-scorer of the series, with 275 runs from five innings at an 
                        impressive average of 91.66.[67] Kohli's success on the field belies the stereotype of him as a brash 
                        and arrogant player. In fact, Indian captain MS Dhoni has noted that "he has grabbed his chances" and 
                        that "he has matured now." Dhoni went on to say that "To us, he comes as a 'humble guy'. He might come

                        in India's match against Pakistan, Kohli became the fastest batsman in terms of innings to score 11,000

                        In September 2021, Kohli was named as the captain of India's squad for the 2021 ICC Men's T20 World 
                        Cup. However, Kohli also publicly announced his decision to step down from the role of T20I captain

                        In December 2021, Kohli was replaced by Rohit Sharma as India's ODI captain. The BCCI President, 
                        Sourav Ganguly, disclosed that Kohli's removal from the ODI captaincy was attributed to the selectors

                        side in ODI.[304] In the third match of the series, Kohli delivered a prodigious performance, amassing 
                        an unbeaten 166 runs from 110 balls. This century, his 21st in India, marked a milestone as he surpassed 
                        all other players for the most ODI centuries scored in the country. Additionally, his performance in this 
                        match elevated him to become the fifth highest run-scorer in ODI cricket, going ahead of Mahela Jayawardene.
                        Following Kohli's performance, India went on to win the third ODI match by a record margin of 317 runs.
                        In February–March 2023, Kohli played in the Border-Gavaskar series of 2023.

                Kohli's romantic association with Bollywood actress Anushka Sharma, which commenced in 2013, earned the duo 
            the moniker of "Virushka".During an interview with Graham Bensinger, Kohli divulged that he had encountered 
            Sharma for the first time, when they were both were engaged in a promotional shoot for Clear shampoo.Their 
            union since then has attracted significant media interest, with persistent rumours and speculations swirling 
            around in the press, as both parties remained reticent about publicly discussing the relationship.On 
            11 December 2017, the couple exchanged nuptials in an intimate ceremony held in Florence, Italy, becoming one of 
            the most talked-about celebrity couples in the country.On 11 January 2021, the couple had their first child, a daughter, 
            who was named Vamika.The child's name, Vamika, is derived from Sanskrit, meaning "little goddess".
